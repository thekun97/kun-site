description:

    I am modifying the Proof-of-Authority consensus algorithm to be suitable for low-powered IoT devices.

    With the goal of eliminating the leader/follower mechanism and running asynchronously.

    Adding a lightweight competitive mechanism for miners by Threshold-BLS digital signature.
